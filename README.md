# File Craftsman

The File Craftsman is a Python project that allows you to generate random text files and directories for practice and experimentation. It also includes a web scraping feature to obtain random information for creating longer text content.

## Features

- Random File Generation: The program generates a specified number of random text files with random content. You can define the number of files, file names, and content length.

- Directory Creation: The program creates directories with random names and a specified number of subdirectories. This helps simulate a folder structure for testing or practicing file operations.

- Web Scraping for Information: The application utilizes web scraping techniques to obtain random information from websites. You can specify the number of items to fetch, and the program will retrieve them from reliable sources.

- The Web Scraper is a Python program that allows you to scrape a random sample of web pages and store the extracted data in JSON format. It provides the flexibility to limit the number of URLs to scrape and organizes the scraped data into separate JSON files. Finally, it merges all the JSON files into a single file.

**Note: The information fetched from websites is random and can be used to create diverse content.**
